Part A

    Go to the official AgentPy framework documentation page: AgentPy Documentation 

    Links to an external site..
    Replicate at least 3 example models found in the "Model Library" section, for this you will have to install the python module.
    For each model, you will add the following to the agent(s) involved:
        Function see()
        Function next()
        Function action()
        A list or dictionary or set or similar called "internal_states" containing the possible internal states of the agent (however simple they may be).
        Note: Each function must have their inputs and outputs as seen in class.
    You will have to determine (at your discretion) what process is inside each function, as long as it fulfills its purpose. Remember that you are the designers.
    Run each model and observe that the simulations continue to give the same results as originally modeled.

In the end, what you are getting are agent simulations with internal state.

Part B

    For each example model you used above, you must define a utility function (as you see fit).
    To demonstrate this utility function, you should create graphs showing how each agent performs with respect to this utility.
